**PYTHON - NETWORK (PROJECT 21 | WEEK 08)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be working on networks, where we introduce PIP and JSON.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Here, we will be learning what packahes are, how to install, view and use packages.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. What's my status? #1(3pts)
1. Response header value #1(7pts)
2. POST an email #1(5pts)
3. Error code #1(3pts)
4. Search API(9pts)
5. My GitHub!(6pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
