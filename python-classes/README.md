**PYTHON - CLASSES & OBJECTS (PROJECT 18 | WEEK 07)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

From data structures, imports and modules, we now move into the worls of OOP; Object Oriented Programming. For this week, we will focus our studies on classes and object, so we understand all the basics.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Though broad, the basics of classes and objects can be understood in smaller parts. And that is our goal for this week.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Square with size(12pts)
1. Size validation(10pts)
2. Area of a square(7pts)
3. Access and update private attribute(16pts)
4. Printing a square(7pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
