**PYTHON - OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING 1 & 2 (PROJECT 22/23 | WEEK 10)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning on Object Relational Mapping and how to connect MySQL to python.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Here, we will be learning how to connect to MySQL database from a python script,
how to select and insert rows in python, what ORM is and how to map a python class to a MySQL table..

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Get all states(9pts)
1. Filter states(10pts)
2. Filter states by user input(12pts)
3. SQL Injection...(10pts)
4. Cities by states(9pts)
5. All cities by state(12pts)
6. First state model(9pts)
7. All states via SQLAlchemy(9pts)
8. First state(9pts)
9. Contains `a`(11pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
