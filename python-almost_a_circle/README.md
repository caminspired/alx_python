**PYTHON - ALMOST A CIRCLE (PROJECT 20 | WEEK 08)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be working on "almost a circle". Here, we want to delve deeper into OOP, arguments and testing our files.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Here, we want to delve deepr into OOP, focusing on \*args, \*\*kwargs, JSON files and testing.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Base class(20pts)
1. First Rectangle(36pts)
2. Validate attributes(64pts)
3. Area first(16pts)
4. Display #0(24pts)
5. **str**(20pts)
6. Display #1(16pts)
7. Update #0(23pts)
8. Update #1(40pts)
9. And now, the Square!(32pts)
10. Square size(16pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
