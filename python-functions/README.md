**PYTHON - FUNCTIONS (PROJECT 13 | WEEK 05)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

With this project, we delve a bit into python functins, building on our print function learnt in the previous project, "Hello World".

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The objectives are to get us familiar with python funtions, by completing 7 tasks.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. a + b(7pts)
1. a ^ b(14pts)
2. Temperature Converter Function(6pts)
3. String Manipulation Function(3pts)
4. Fibonacci Sequence Function(5pts)
5. Prime Number Function(5pts)
6. Password Validation Function
   (5pts).

# MANUAL REVIEW

Unlike the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, SO once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
