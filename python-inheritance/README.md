**PYTHON - INHERITANCE (PROJECT 19 | WEEK 07)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

Building on classes and their attributes, we learn about how an instance of an object can inherit an attribute, what super, base and prent classes are, and many more.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Here, we want to delve deepr into classes and objects, and how create subclasses and what the purpose of inheritance actually is..

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Exact same object(12pts)
1. Same class or inherit from(12pts)
2. Only sub class of(12pts)
3. Geometry module(7pts)
4. Improve Geometry(5pts)
5. Integer validator(12pts)
6. Rectangle(12pts)
7. Full rectangle(12pts)
8. Square #1(12pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
