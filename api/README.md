**PYTHON API (PROJECT 34 | WEEK 16)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning about Python API's.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are to understand what API's, REST API, microservices, the CSV format and the JSON format are. We will also discuss Pythonic Package and module name styles, Pythonic Class name styles, Pythonic Variable name style, Pythonic Function name styles, Pythonic Constant name style and the significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Gather data from an API(6pts)
1. Export to CSV(4pts)
2. Export to JSON(4pts)
3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries(3pts)

# REVIEW

Once this is complete, we will need to show that we are ready for review by selecting the "Ready for my review" tab to enable our peers to review us. Note that, without a manual review the project isincomplete and there will be no grade awarded. You would also need to put in time to review a peer, as it is only right to give what been given to you.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
