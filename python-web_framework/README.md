**PYTHON - OBJECT RELATIONAL MAPPING 1 (PROJECT 22 | WEEK 11)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning on Object Relational Mapping and how to connect MySQL to python.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Here, we will be learning how to connect to MySQL database from a python script,
how to select and insert rows in python, what ORM is and how to map a python class to a MySQL table..

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Get all states(9pts)
1. Filter states(10pts)
2. Filter states by user input(12pts)
3. SQL Injection...(10pts)
4. Cities by states(9pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
