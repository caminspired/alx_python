**PYTHON - WEB FRAMEWORK 1 & 2 (PROJECT 24/25 | WEEK 11)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning python web frameworks like flask, routing and handling variables in a route.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Here, we will be learning what Web Frameworks are, how to build a web framework and define routes with Flask.
We will also learn how to handle variables in a route, what a template is, how to create an HTML response in Flask by using a template, how to create a dynamic template (loops, conditions…)
, and finally, how to display in HTML data from a MySQL database.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Hello Flask!(10pts)
1. HBNB(10pts)
2. C is fun!(10pts)
3. Python is cool!(12pts)
4. Is it a number?(11pts)
5. Number template(11pts)
6. Odd or even?(11PTS)
7. Set up Flask with SQLAlchemy(9pts)
8. Add and Retrieve Users(11pts)
9. Update and Delete Users(11pts)

# REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
