**PYTHON - MORE DATA STRUCTURES: SET, DICTIONARY (PROJECT 18 | WEEK 06)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

Here, we expands on our knowledge on data structures by exploring sets and dictionaries as a build-on to lists and tuples.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The objectives are to learn and explore data structures, with regards to disctionaries, sets and more.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Squared simple(10pts)
1. Present in both(12pts)
2. Update dictionary(10pts)
3. Best score(9pts)
4. Multiply by using map(10pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

For this project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
