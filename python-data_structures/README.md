**PYTHON - DATA STRUCTURES: LISTS, TUPLES (PROJECT 17 | WEEK 06)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

With the previous project, we learnt about importing files and parts of files(functions), now, we are going to delve into the world of lists and, tuples in data structures.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The objectives are to understand what lists and tuples are, their differences, and, how/when to use them.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Can you C me now?(10pts)
1. Lists of lists = Matrix(10pts)
2. More returns!(8pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
